## Development Plan

1. **Set up the development environment**: Install Astro.js, Golang, MySQL, and any other necessary dependencies.

2. **Design the application architecture**: Plan out the structure of your frontend and backend, and how they will interact with each other and the database.

3. **Develop the backend APIs**: Use Golang to create RESTful APIs for handling user authentication, managing expenses, and generating reports.

4. **Set up the MySQL database**: Design the database schema and set up the necessary tables for storing user and expense data.

5. **Develop the frontend**: Use Astro.js to create the user interface. This includes the login/register pages, the dashboard, the expense tracking page, and the reports page.
